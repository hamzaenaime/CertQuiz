## üîç How It Works Technically

### Latest Comments First
- Looks at all comments for each question
- Finds the most recent comment timestamp
- Sorts questions by that timestamp (newest first)
- Questions without comments go to the end

### Most Comments First
- Counts comments for each question
- Sorts by count (descending)
- Questions with 0 comments appear last

### No Comments First
- Questions with 0 comments appear first
- Then sorted by question number
- Questions with comments appear at the end

### Date-Based Sorts
- Uses `updatedAt` or `createdAt` timestamps
- Sorts in descending order (newest first)
- Shows most recent activity at the top

---

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

- Sorting is instant (happens in memory)
- No additional Firebase queries needed
- Works with filtered results
- Can sort hundreds of questions quickly

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Sort Doesn't Change
- **Refresh page**: Ensure latest data is loaded
- **Check dropdown**: Make sure selection changed
- **Clear filters**: Try "All Topics" first

### "Latest Comments" Shows Wrong Order
- **Check timestamps**: Comments need valid timestamps
- **Reload page**: Force fresh data from Firebase
- **Check browser console**: Look for errors

### Questions Disappear After Sorting
- **They didn't disappear**: Just moved in the list
- **Scroll down**: They might be at the bottom
- **Check filters**: You might have topic filter active

### Sort Resets When Editing
- **This is normal**: After editing, list refreshes
- **Re-select sort**: Choose your sort method again
- **Or**: Make multiple edits before sorting
