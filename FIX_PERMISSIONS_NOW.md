## ❓ Why This Happens

By default, Firebase **blocks all access** to protect your data. You need to explicitly allow your app to read/write data by updating the security rules.

---

## 🔒 Is This Safe?

For development and internal tools: **YES**

These rules allow:
- Anyone to read/write comments
- Anyone to read/write questions
- Perfect for your quiz app

For production (if making it public), see [FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md) for more secure options.

---

## ✅ After Fixing Permissions

You'll be able to:
1. ✅ Deploy questions to Firebase
2. ✅ Load quiz questions from database
3. ✅ Post and delete comments
4. ✅ Use the admin portal fully

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)

2. **Check rules are saved**: Go back to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules and verify your changes are there

3. **Check browser console**: Press `F12`, look at the Console tab for error messages

4. **See detailed guide**: Open [FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md)
