## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Firebase Security Rules

Before deploying questions or using the application, you **MUST** update Firebase security rules:

**See [FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SECURITY_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.**

Quick steps:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
3. Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` file
4. Click "Publish"

Without this step, you'll get "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors.

## How Questions Are Loaded

The quiz now follows this loading strategy:

1. **Primary**: Try to load from Firebase
   - Queries `questions` collection by topic
   - Sorts by question number
   - Shows loading message

2. **Fallback**: If Firebase fails or no data found
   - Falls back to local JS files
   - Uses the original import system
   - Shows appropriate loading message

## Firebase Structure

### Questions Collection
```javascript
{
  question: "Question text...",
  answers: {
    a: "Option A",
    b: "Option B",
    c: "Option C",
    d: "Option D"
  },
  correctAnswer: "a" or ["a", "b"],
  explanation: "Explanation text...",
  multiSelect: true/false,
  topic: "architect" | "cloud" | "integration",
  questionNumber: 1,
  createdAt: "2025-01-21T...",
  updatedAt: "2025-01-21T..."
}
```

### Comments Collection
```javascript
{
  questionId: 0,
  text: "Comment text...",
  author: "User Name",
  isAnonymous: false,
  userId: "user_123...",
  votes: 0,
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp,
  createdAt: "2025-01-21T..."
}
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Implementation**: Credentials are hardcoded in `js/admin.js`

For production, consider:
- Firebase Authentication
- Backend authentication service
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting for login attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Questions Not Loading from Firebase
1. Check Firebase configuration in `firebase-config.js`
2. Verify Firestore security rules allow reads
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure questions were deployed for the correct topic

### Comments Not Deleting
1. Verify Firestore security rules allow deletes
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure admin is logged in

### Deploy Tool Issues
1. Verify Firebase configuration
2. Check that `quiz-data.js` exports `quizData`
3. Review browser console for errors
4. Check Firestore security rules allow writes

## Next Steps

To fully utilize this system:

1. **Deploy Questions**: Use `deploy-questions.html` to load questions into Firebase
2. **Test Quiz**: Open `index.html` and verify questions load from Firebase
3. **Manage Content**: Use `admin.html` to manage both questions and comments
4. **Monitor**: Check statistics in admin portal regularly

## URLs Quick Reference

- **Main Quiz**: `/index.html`
- **Admin Portal**: `/admin.html`
- **Deploy Tool**: `/deploy-questions.html`
- **Test Firebase**: `/test-firebase.html`
